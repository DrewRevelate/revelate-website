# Revelate Website - Next Steps

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the Express.js implementation and deployment.

## Implementation Progress

We've made significant progress in converting the static website to an Express.js application:

- ✅ Created the Express.js application structure
- ✅ Set up the PostgreSQL database connection
- ✅ Implemented the contact form API
- ✅ Created basic EJS templates
- ✅ Prepared deployment scripts

## Completing the Implementation

To finish the implementation, follow these steps:

### 1. Run the setup script

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Install dependencies
- Move static assets to the correct directories
- Configure environment variables
- Set up the database

### 2. Test the application locally

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to ensure everything is working correctly.

### 3. Deploy to GitHub and Heroku

```bash
# Make the deploy script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the deploy script
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- Commit your changes
- Push to GitHub
- Deploy to Heroku
- Set up the PostgreSQL database on Heroku

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Test all pages on the live site
- [ ] Verify form submissions are being stored in the database
- [ ] Configure any additional environment variables in Heroku
- [ ] Set up a custom domain (if needed)

## Database Schema

The database has been configured with the following tables:

### Contacts Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  company VARCHAR(255),
  interest VARCHAR(50),
  message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or deployment:

1. Check the `.env` file for correct database credentials
2. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
3. Verify that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
4. Check Heroku logs with `heroku logs --tail`
