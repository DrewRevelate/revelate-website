                    <p>22q Family Foundation Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting families affected by 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome. Its mission is to raise awareness of this genetic disorder while connecting and providing accurate information to the families in its community.</p>
                    
                    <p>The foundation operates nationwide, coordinating resources, education, and events to fulfill its mission. As the organization grew, it recognized the need for a robust CRM solution to manage donors, volunteers, and program participants more effectively.</p>
                    
                    <p>Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud was identified as the ideal platform to unify these efforts because of its ability to centralize fundraising, program management, and communications tailored for nonprofits.</p>

                <p class="section-subtitle">Before the implementation, 22q Family Foundation faced several operational challenges that hindered its efficiency and growth:</p>
                
                <div class="challenges-grid">
                    <div class="challenge-card" data-aos="fade-up">
                        <div class="challenge-icon">
                            <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Disorganized Data Management</h3>
                        <p>The foundation's existing donor and contact data were scattered and inconsistent. Over time, duplicate records and outdated information accumulated, making it difficult to trust the data for outreach or reporting.</p>
                        <p>Without a clean data structure, staff often struggled to locate accurate records of donors or families, and important history or details could be overlooked.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                        <div class="challenge-icon">
                            <i class="fas fa-unlink"></i>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Lack of System Integration</h3>
                        <p>Key systems were not connected to Salesforce, resulting in siloed information. The foundation used GiveSmart for fundraising campaigns/events and RunSignUp for managing participants in its charity runs, but these platforms did not feed data into the main CRM.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, email communications were handled in Outlook with no integration, so interactions with supporters were not captured centrally. This lack of integration meant staff had to manually export and import data between systems, which was time-consuming and error-prone.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="challenge-card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">

                        </div>
                        <h3>Operational Inefficiencies</h3>
                        <p>Because of the fragmented systems and messy data, everyday processes were inefficient. Generating reports for board meetings or grant applications required piecing together data from multiple sources and spreadsheets.</p>
                        <p>Segmenting donors for campaigns or tracking which constituents attended events involved significant manual effort. These inefficiencies consumed staff time and posed a risk of missing opportunities. Valuable staff hours were spent on administrative tasks rather than on mission-centric work.</p>

                            <p>By ensuring the data was accurate and well-structured, the foundation gained a reliable database for all constituents and donations. Clean data laid the groundwork for effective use of the CRM and instilled confidence that staff were working with up-to-date information.</p>

                            <p>We performed a deep dive into the existing Salesforce data to identify duplicates, incomplete records, and structural issues. With the client's input, we defined the proper data model for contacts, donations, and other records in Nonprofit Cloud.

                            <p>Once data integrity was addressed, we configured the integrations with external systems. For GiveSmart, this meant setting up a connector to pull in donation and event data. For RunSignUp, we designed a process to regularly import race registrations and fundraising results. In parallel, the Salesforce-Outlook integration was configured to sync emails and calendar events.</p>

                            <p>With clean data and incoming data flows in place, we built the agreed-upon reports and dashboards in Salesforce. We used Salesforce's reporting tools to craft each report and organized these into dashboard views for at-a-glance insight. Throughout this process, feedback from the 22q team was incorporated to ensure the final reports were tailored and immediately useful.</p>

                            <p>Before full rollout, a comprehensive testing phase was conducted. Key foundation staff tested common use cases: entering a new donation, checking an integrated GiveSmart transaction in Salesforce, running reports, and more. Any bugs were identified and resolved. Once the system passed testing, we led hands-on training sessions to ensure the foundation's team was comfortable with the new tools.</p>

                        <p>All of the foundation's constituent data is now consolidated in one system. Data silos have been eliminated – the team no longer needs to look in multiple places to get a full view of a supporter.</p>
                        <p>The cleanup effort means that records are accurate and up-to-date; each individual has a single, complete contact record instead of fragmented or duplicate entries. This leads to better relationship management – when contacting a donor or parent, anyone on the team can quickly see past donations, event attendance, and notes from previous conversations.</p>

                        <p>By integrating GiveSmart, RunSignUp, and Outlook, the foundation has dramatically reduced manual data work. Tasks that used to take hours of copying information between systems have been automated.</p>
                        <p>The team estimates that they save 5–8 hours per week in manual data entry and reconciliation. Report generation, which once could take days of compiling data, is now done in minutes with Salesforce dashboards. These time savings allow the small team to redirect effort toward more valuable activities like donor outreach and program development.</p>

                        <p>With the new system, the foundation can engage supporters more effectively. The GiveSmart integration means online donations and event pledges are immediately recorded, allowing for faster thank-you responses and follow-ups to donors.</p>
                        <p>Because every interaction is tracked, the foundation has a 360-degree view of its constituents. This holistic insight helps in segmenting communications – for example, they can quickly pull a list of all participants from the last run event and send them a targeted update about an upcoming program.</p>

                        <h3>Improved Reporting and Decision-Making</h3>
                        <p>The custom reports and dashboards have become invaluable for management and the board. Instead of working with anecdotal information, decisions are now backed by real data.</p>
                        <p>The Donation Tracking dashboard provides up-to-the-minute progress toward fundraising goals, so the team can adjust their strategies in real time. The Executive Director can quickly prepare for board meetings with visual charts showing key metrics, rather than spending days pulling numbers.</p>

                            <p>The team at Revelate Operations transformed our Salesforce instance from a data repository into a strategic engine. Tasks that used to require multiple steps across different tools can now be accomplished within Salesforce alone. Having everything under one roof gives us greater peace of mind that nothing will slip through the cracks.</p>
                            <p>This new system has been a game-changer for how we manage relationships and fundraising. We're confident that with this Salesforce foundation in place, our organization is better positioned to grow its impact.</p>

                        <p>A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work. We took time to understand 22q Family Foundation's mission and specific operational needs. The solutions were then tailored to support those needs directly, ensuring the technology truly empowered the staff's day-to-day work in support of the mission.</p>

                        <h3>Data Cleanup as a Foundation for Success</h3>
                        <p>One of the standout factors in this project's success was the early emphasis on data integrity. By auditing and cleaning the existing data, the foundation avoided simply "garbage in, garbage out" in the new system. Investing time in data quality upfront paid off by making every subsequent step function smoothly.</p>

                        <p>By connecting GiveSmart, RunSignUp, and Outlook, 22q Family Foundation eliminated silos and created a single ecosystem for all their stakeholder interactions. The immediate effect was a reduction in manual work and a more holistic view of each supporter.</p>

                        <p>The project didn't end with just technical configuration; training the end users was pivotal. By involving the foundation's staff throughout the process and providing hands-on training, the team was comfortable and confident using the new Salesforce system from day one.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, the 22q Family Foundation's Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud implementation was a model project in many ways. It achieved the client's goals of cleaner data, integrated systems, and better reporting, all while satisfying the client and staying on schedule.</p>
                    <p>The foundation is now better equipped to cultivate donor relationships, manage events, and track its impact on the community. This success story serves as an encouraging example for other nonprofits looking to leverage technology to further their mission.</p>
